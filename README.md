Hi, this is かがみ a web front-end developer. In recent yaers I write JavaScript/TypeScript code, and sometimes practise C#.

I like indoor activities like watching anime and reading novel. And I also spare some time in the development of [poi, a kancolle browser](https://github.com/poooi/poi)

I speak Chinese, English and French, and also knows a little of Japanese.
